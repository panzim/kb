These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results.

      "In the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting with LaMDA, so that people can engage directly with them.

Later this year, Multisearch will be able to help people find local results near them. AI is also helping improve translation.

I would say - as you're asking how are we looking forward, I would say, the revenue growth rates that we delivered in 2021 in Search and across our advertising businesses more generally, as I said in opening comments, did benefit from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. So I think one key point is that we're not going to have that tailwind for the rest of this year. And as I noted, one of the key areas to focus is Q2 of 2020.

In terms of revenues, the most direct impact is the fact that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia, as we announced in early March. And to your question, about 1% of Google revenues were from Russia in 2021, and that was primarily from advertising. In addition, from the outset of the war, there was a pull-back in advertiser spend, particularly on YouTube in Europe. So a couple of impacts from the war.

And if we take the creator view, we're taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their short-form videos. The first step I think is our $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund, which is now available in over 100 countries globally. And over 40% of creators who received payment from the Shorts Fund in 2021 weren't in the YouTube Partner Program, just as an interesting number.

In terms of the deceleration in the year-on-year revenue growth rate relative to the first quarter, the largest factor was lapping an exceptionally strong quarter in direct response, as we noted last year.' metadata={'source': '2022_Q1_Earnings_Transcript.pdf', 'chunk_index': 104}\n",

And people are creating - comment - content on YouTube at a very active rate. We're really pleased with what we see there. And our team does remain focused on innovating and helping creators grow.

On YouTube, I think what we're hearing is that there's an emerging concern that TikTok is a competitor to YouTube's mobile position.

And any type of advertising, maybe, shift on mobile because of TikTok?\n",

And more people are creating content on YouTube than we've ever seen before.  And the team remains very focused in trying to help creators grow, trying to innovate. And just to give you a number, in 2021, the number of YouTube channels that had made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year over year. And we're heavily investing in Shorts and the Connected TV and Shopping. You heard the stats from Sundar on the 30 billion daily views. So we continue to invest.

So in the U.S., we were pleased with the 27% year-on-year growth. And I think nothing to call out there. In Europe, as you noted in your question, the slightly bigger impact from the war in Ukraine than in other regions. And then the sizable delta between fixed and floating really reflects the meaningful strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. I guess to the heart of your question with respect to APAC, the main thing there is to take you back to a year ago. We were lapping a substantial 39% growth rate in constant currency. And so this really reflects lapping that sizable growth relative to more muted ads performance in APAC this first quarter, and it really takes you just back to last quarter.

These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results.

These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results.

There's really good work that was done, started by Ruth, Sundar, and the rest of the lead team, to re-engineer the cost base. But I think any organization can always push a little further.\n",

Our commitment to innovation, as well as our long-term focus and investment in AI, are paying off and driving success for the company and for our customers.\n",
      "We are uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI because of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation, and we're now seeing this operate at scale. It has three components:\n",

      "We're also doing important work inside our data centers to drive efficiencies, while making significant hardware and model improvements.\n",
      "For example, we shared that since we first began testing AI Overviews, we've lowered machine costs per query significantly. In eighteen months, we reduced costs by more than 90% for these queries through hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs, while doubling the size of our custom Gemini model.' metadata={'source': '2024q1-alphabet-earnings-release-pdf.pdf', 'chunk_index': 58}\n",

      "The integration of ads within AI Overviews is also performing well, helping people connect with businesses as they search.\n",
      "Circle to Search is now available on over 150 million Android devices, with people using it to shop, translate text, and learn more about the world around them. A third of the people who have tried Circle to Search now use it weekly, a testament to its helpfulness and potential.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Lens is now used for over 20 billion visual searches per month.

When Snap was looking to power more innovative experiences within their 'My AI' chatbot, they chose Gemini's strong multimodal capabilities. Since then, Snap saw over 2.5 times as much engagement with My AI in the United States.\n",
      "Third, customers use our AI platform together with our data platform, BigQuery, because we analyze multi-modal data, no matter where it is stored, with ultra-low latency access to Gemini. This enables accurate, real-time decision making for customers like Hiscox, one of the flagship syndicates in Lloyd's of London, which reduced the time it took to quote complex risks, from days to minutes.

      "First, the margins at Cloud really started to ramp nicely. There are comps in the industry with still materially higher operating margins, I imagine that's a matter of scale and trying to catch up from a third-place position, but how do you think about the margin trends that you're seeing? And what's your level of confidence that those margins can kind of match up to other industry players that are doing closer to 30% margins?' metadata={'source': '2024q1-alphabet-earnings-release-pdf.pdf', 'chunk_index': 109}\n",

Like, what do you see as the biggest opportunities to kind of take those margins and maybe over time take them materially higher? Thank you very much.\n",
      "Anat Ashkenazi, SVP &amp; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Mark, for both of these questions. Let me start on the Cloud margin.\n",
      "Certainly, very pleased to see not just the top-line growth rate, but the margin expansion to 17%. Really outstanding work by our Cloud team to drive continued benefit to customers. And as you think about that margin expansion, really, it's a few things. You've mentioned one of them.\n",

      "Hard to obviously compare to any of our peers or competitors. It's a different business. But more to come.\n",
      "Now, the one thing to remember, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, this is an area that requires investment. And a lot of this investments, if you think about servers, et cetera, is based on demand we're seeing from customers. So this will translate to revenue in the fairly short term.\n",

There's really good work that was done, started by Ruth, Sundar, and the rest of the lead team, to re-engineer the cost base. But I think any organization can always push a little further.\n",
      "And I'll be looking at additional opportunities really across all the elements that I've mentioned on my prepared remarks. Think not just about the size of the organization, but mostly how we operate and how we run the business.\n",

These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.' metadata={'source': '2025q2-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf', 'chunk_index': 14}\n",

We  believe  that  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  meaningful supplemental  information  regarding  our  performance  and  liquidity  by  excluding  certain  items  that  may  not  be indicative  of  our  recurring  core  business  operating  results,  such  as  our  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both  management  and  investors  benefit  from  referring  to  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  assessing  our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.' metadata={'source': '2024q2-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf', 'chunk_index': 33}\n",
