With your own Project Mariner efforts and a competitor's recent launch, it seems there's suddenly really strong momentum on AI consumer agents and kind of catching up to that old Google Duplex vision.\\nWhen you look a few years ahead, where do you see consumer agents going? And really, what does it mean to Google Search, outside of Lens? Is there room for both to flourish, or will they eventually both be in conflict with each other? Thank you.\\nSundar Pichai, CEO, Alphabet and Google: Look, I think, first of all, we are definitely seeing a lot of progress in the underlying capabilities of these models. Gemini 2.0 was definitely built with a view of enabling more agentic use cases.\\nSo we are definitely seeing progress inside, and I think we'll be able to do more agentic experiences for our users.\"),\n",
