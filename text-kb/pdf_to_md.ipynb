Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the  SEC. All  information  provided  in  this  release  and  in  the  attachments  is  as  of  July  23,  2024.  Undue  reliance should  not  be  placed  on  the  forward-looking  statements  in  this  press  release,  which  are  based  on  information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\\n\\n## About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change  in  constant  currency  revenues.  The  presentation  of  this  financial  information  is  not  intended  to  be considered in  isolation  or  as  a  substitute  for,  or  superior  to,  the  financial  information  prepared  and  presented  in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nWe  use  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  for  financial  and  operational  decision-making  and  as  a  means  to evaluate  period-to-period  comparisons.  We  believe  that  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  meaningful supplemental  information  regarding  our  performance  and  liquidity  by  excluding  certain  items  that  may  not  be indicative  of  our  recurring  core  business  operating  results,  such  as  our  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both  management  and  investors  benefit  from  referring  to  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  assessing  our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\\n\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial  measures  in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned 'Reconciliation from  GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  to  Non-GAAP  Free  Cash  Flow'  and  'Reconciliation  from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to NonGAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues' included at the end of this release.\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nInvestor relations Media investor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n\\n## Alphabet Inc.

Google  Cloud  generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services,  Google  Workspace  communication  and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n- Other Bets is  a  combination  of  multiple  operating  segments  that  are  not  individually  material.  Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\n\\nCertain  costs  are  not  allocated  to  our  segments  because  they  represent  Alphabet-level  activities.  These  costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&amp;D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements.

We  calculate  the  percentage  change  in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\\n\\n## Revenues by Geography\\n\\nComparison from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\\n\\n|                                    |

Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the  SEC. All  information  provided  in  this  release  and  in  the  attachments  is  as  of  July  23,  2024.  Undue  reliance should  not  be  placed  on  the  forward-looking  statements  in  this  press  release,  which  are  based  on  information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\\n\\n## About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change  in  constant  currency  revenues.  The  presentation  of  this  financial  information  is  not  intended  to  be considered in  isolation  or  as  a  substitute  for,  or  superior  to,  the  financial  information  prepared  and  presented  in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nWe  use  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  for  financial  and  operational  decision-making  and  as  a  means  to evaluate  period-to-period  comparisons.  We  believe  that  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  meaningful supplemental  information  regarding  our  performance  and  liquidity  by  excluding  certain  items  that  may  not  be indicative  of  our  recurring  core  business  operating  results,  such  as  our  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both  management  and  investors  benefit  from  referring  to  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  assessing  our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\\n\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial  measures  in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned 'Reconciliation from  GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  to  Non-GAAP  Free  Cash  Flow'  and  'Reconciliation  from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to NonGAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues' included at the end of this release.\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nInvestor relations Media investor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n\\n## Alphabet Inc.

Google  Cloud  generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services,  Google  Workspace  communication  and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n- Other Bets is  a  combination  of  multiple  operating  segments  that  are  not  individually  material.  Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\n\\nCertain  costs  are  not  allocated  to  our  segments  because  they  represent  Alphabet-level  activities.  These  costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&amp;D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions  during  2023  and  employee  severance  in  2024  were  also  not  allocated  to  our  segments.

We  calculate  the  percentage  change  in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.\\n\\n## Revenues by Geography\\n\\nComparison from the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\\n\\n|                                    |
