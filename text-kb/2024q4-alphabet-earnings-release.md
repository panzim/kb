## About Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in  constant  currency  revenues.  The  presentation  of  this  financial  information  is  not  intended  to  be  considered  in isolation  or  as  a  substitute  for,  or  superior  to,  the  financial  information  prepared  and  presented  in  accordance  with GAAP.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information  regarding  our  performance  and  liquidity  by  excluding  certain  items  that  may  not  be  indicative  of  our recurring  core  business  operating  results,  such  as  our  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  exchange  rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.

There  are  a  number  of  limitations  related  to  the  use  of  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  We  compensate  for  these limitations  by  providing  specific  information  regarding  the  GAAP  amounts  excluded  from  these  non-GAAP  financial measures  and  evaluating  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  together  with  their  relevant  financial  measures  in accordance with GAAP.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned 'Reconciliation from GAAP Net  Cash  Provided  by  Operating Activities  to  Non-GAAP  Free  Cash  Flow'  and  'Reconciliation  from  GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues' included at the end of this release.

(1) Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q4 2024, the net effect of the gain on equity securities of $364 million and the performance fees related to certain investments of $43 million increased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted net income per share by $67 million, $254 million, and $0.02, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&amp;E in future periods.

## Reconciliation  from  GAAP  Net  Cash  Provided  by  Operating  Activities  to  Non-GAAP  Free  Cash  Flow (in millions; unaudited) :

We  provide  non-GAAP  free  cash  flow  because  it  is  a  liquidity  measure  that  provides  useful  information  to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.

Reconciliation  from  GAAP  Revenues  to  Non-GAAP  Constant  Currency  Revenues  and  GAAP  Percentage Change  in  Revenues  to  Non-GAAP  Percentage  Change  in  Constant  Currency  Revenues (in  millions,  except percentages; unaudited) :

We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues ('constant currency revenues') and non-GAAP percentage change in  constant  currency  revenues  ('percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues'),  because  they  facilitate  the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements ('FX Effect') as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.

Non-GAAP  constant  currency  revenues  is  defined  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  exchange  rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates  and  excluding  any  hedging  effect  recognized  in  the  current  period.  We  calculate  the  percentage  change  in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.
