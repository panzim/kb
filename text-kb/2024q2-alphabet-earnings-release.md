## About Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change  in  constant  currency  revenues.  The  presentation  of  this  financial  information  is  not  intended  to  be considered in  isolation  or  as  a  substitute  for,  or  superior  to,  the  financial  information  prepared  and  presented  in accordance with GAAP.

We  use  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  for  financial  and  operational  decision-making  and  as  a  means  to evaluate  period-to-period  comparisons.  We  believe  that  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  meaningful supplemental  information  regarding  our  performance  and  liquidity  by  excluding  certain  items  that  may  not  be indicative  of  our  recurring  core  business  operating  results,  such  as  our  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both  management  and  investors  benefit  from  referring  to  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  assessing  our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.

There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial  measures  in accordance with GAAP.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned 'Reconciliation from  GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  to  Non-GAAP  Free  Cash  Flow'  and  'Reconciliation  from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to NonGAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues' included at the end of this release.

(1) Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q2 2024, the net effect of the loss on equity securities  of  $714  million  and  the  $128  million  reversal  of  previously  accrued  performance  fees  related  to  certain investments decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $123 million, $463 million, and $0.04, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&amp;E in future periods.

## Reconciliation  from  GAAP  Net  Cash  Provided  by  Operating  Activities  to  Non-GAAP  Free  Cash  Flow (in millions; unaudited) :

We  provide  non-GAAP  free  cash  flow  because  it  is  a  liquidity  measure  that  provides  useful  information  to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

|                                           | Quarter Ended June 30, 2024   |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 26,640                      |
| Less: purchases of property and equipment | (13,186)                      |
| Free cash flow                            | $ 13,454                      |

Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.

Reconciliation  from  GAAP  Revenues  to  Non-GAAP  Constant  Currency  Revenues  and  GAAP  Percentage Change  in  Revenues  to  Non-GAAP  Percentage  Change  in  Constant  Currency  Revenues (in  millions,  except percentages; unaudited) :

We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues ('constant currency revenues') and non-GAAP percentage change in  constant  currency  revenues  ('percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues'),  because  they  facilitate  the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements ('FX Effect') as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.

Non-GAAP  constant  currency  revenues  is  defined  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  exchange  rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates  and  excluding  any  hedging  effect  recognized  in  the  current  period.  We  calculate  the  percentage  change  in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.
